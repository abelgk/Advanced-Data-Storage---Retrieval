Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
Choose a start date and end date for your trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.
Use SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to your sqlite database.
Use SQLAlchemy automap_base() to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.
Precipitation Analysis
  Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
  Select only the date and prcp values.
  Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
  Sort the DataFrame values by date.
  Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
Station Analysis
  Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
  Design a query to find the most active stations.
  List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
  Which station has the highest number of observations?
  Hint: You may need to use functions such as func.min, func.max, func.avg, and func.count in your queries.
  Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
  Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.
  Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.
